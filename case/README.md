# Case
Case assembly can be found in `ASSEMBLY.md`.

Case v15 works fairly well, though I may make a newer iteration that makes the Reset button cutout just a tad bit bigger

Case v16 (by Leo Lou) has a larger cutout, which allows for USB-C boards to be used, and it also makes it easier to access the BOOTSEL button.
