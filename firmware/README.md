# Firmware

This folder holds firmware code. `keezus` is the name of my "homebrew" firmware in Rust. It uses Keyberon to read and report keys, and down the road, will include code that I write that focuses on the graphics/programs that display to the LCD screen.

This place could also hold QMK hex files or KMK files if I every try KMK out.

I may get to putting a QMK VIA(L) hex file here once the folks at QMK engineer a way to get VIA(L) working with the RP2040.
