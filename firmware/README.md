# Firmware

This folder holds firmware code. `keezus` is the name of my "homebrew" firmware in Rust. It uses Keyberon to read and report keys, and down the road, will include code that I write that focuses on the graphics/programs that display to the LCD screen.

I now have a hex file for QMK. The screen works with this hex. For the most up to date firmware/source code, check out my local fork of QMK [here](https://github.com/ChrisChrisLoLo/qmk_firmware/tree/keezyboost40_2/keyboards/sporewoh/keezyboost40)

I may get to putting a QMK VIA(L) hex file here once the folks at QMK engineer a way to get VIA(L) working with the RP2040.
